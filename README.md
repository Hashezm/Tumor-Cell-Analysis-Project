Tumor Cell Analysis Project
Description
This project involves analyzing a dataset of tumor cell measurements collected from 550 patients at a hospital. The dataset includes 30 features per patient that represent various measurable properties of tumor cells. The goal is to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and apply machine learning techniques to classify tumors as malignant or benign.

Features
Data Loading and Cleaning: Loading the dataset, checking for missing values, and performing data imputation.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Generating summary statistics and visualizing correlations between features.
Label Encoding: Encoding the diagnosis column to numerical values.
Data Partitioning: Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Standardization: Standardizing the features.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reducing the number of features.
Logistic Regression Model: Building and evaluating a logistic regression model.
Cross-Validation: Performing k-fold cross-validation.
Final Validation and Prediction: Testing the model on a test set and making predictions on new data.
Data Description
The dataset consists of the following columns:

patient_id: Unique identifier for each patient.
diagnosis: Diagnosis of the tumor cells (M = malignant, B = benign).
feature_1 to feature_30: Numerical features representing various properties of the tumor cells.
The data is located in the file /public/bmort/python/tumor_cells.csv.

Analysis and Results
Data Loading and Cleaning
Loaded the dataset into a DataFrame.
Checked for missing values and performed necessary imputations.
Summary Statistics
Generated summary statistics for each feature.
Identified and handled outliers.
Compared ranges and magnitudes of the features.
Correlation Heatmap
Used Seaborn's heatmap() function to visualize correlations between features.
Label Encoding
Encoded the diagnosis column with 0 for benign and 1 for malignant.
Data Partitioning
Split the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing sets.
Standardization
Standardized the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Applied PCA to reduce the number of features.
Selected the number of components based on explained variance.
Logistic Regression Model
Built a logistic regression model using the PCA-transformed features.
Evaluated the model using k-fold cross-validation.
Final Validation
Tested the model on the test set.
Generated a confusion matrix and calculated accuracy.
Prediction for New Patient
Loaded new patient data from /public/bmort/python/new_patient.pkl.
Predicted the diagnosis using the logistic regression model.
Conclusion
Summarized the findings from the analysis and modeling. Provided insights into the classification performance and the effectiveness of PCA in feature reduction.
